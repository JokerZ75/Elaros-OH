<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our client Elaros is looking to support long Covid sufferers through a Long Covid Occupational Health App named Open OH that will be accessible through a mobile app.
The software should allow long covid sufferers to sign up for an account to manage and communicate their long-term condition with their employer.
<br />
It will allow for the long COVID sufferers to monitor symptoms through carrying out questionnaires and gain information through the resources section that may help to reduce their symptoms. The purpose of the resources section is to facilitate users integrating back into society and the workforce. The application should also allow users to find support at nearby clinics and should display aggregate data to support company research.
